Young, passionate people came to Brandwell with the intention of creating a unique, craft gin brand. Small batches in two flavor variants: Dry and Pink Gin. We like alcohol, who doesn't. But for us, alcohol is not only an opportunity to taste it, but also, and perhaps above all, an opportunity to create its unique image. The way the bottle looks highlights the taste experience.

Sava Gin is a local Warsaw brand, whose name refers to the legend of Wars and Sawa, and the illustration emphasizes the image of a mermaid. Look for its distinctive taste in Warsaw bars. See what happens when you release the gin from the bottle.
