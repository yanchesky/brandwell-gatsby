"History, according to Discovery, is not merely a bunch of dates and events, but stories that can be told from various perspectives". This sentence included in the brief directly contributed to how the brand's graphic identity looks today. The symbol for Discovery Historia is a large capital letter H. We illuminated it, gave it an unusual perspective and thanks to so-called negative space, we created a multidimensional logo. Expressive, symbolic and at the same time literal. This logo ideally reflects the marketer's strategic goal and fully expresses the channel’s remit – we show history from various perspectives and illuminate it from different angles.

There are many elements involved in the graphic design of a TV channel – end-boards, IPM, ad-bumps, menu, single pointer, etc., but the most important element is the channel bug – i.e. the logo. The logo tells its own story.
