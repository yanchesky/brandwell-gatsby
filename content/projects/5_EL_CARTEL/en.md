It would be hard to find a name that smacks of creation more than El Cartel. The name and function of the products literally beg for a specific style. El Cartel is a brand of tattoo accessories. Creating the logo involved finding a symbol that would be characteristic, competent and understandable. In our opinion, the octopus reflects this best.

The style of packaging we came up with for the brand's products is elegant and at the same time "unpolished". Ornamentation using only varnish – painting black on black – is a practice that always venerates the packaging. The red label draws attention and exudes strength. The whole creates a distinctive brand style.
