Perino is a family business specializing in the production of the highest quality, fresh pasta. This is no cliché. The quality of Perino products is amazing! The brand’s owners have inherited the Italian tradition using family recipes, working with Italian ingredients and using old technologies with the overwhelming advantage of manual work. The earlier logo didn’t suggest any of these values. It was neither Italian nor traditional, nor did it point out that all those tortellinis, raviolis, and gnocchis were made by hand. Brandwell has given the brand a new logo – tasteful, traditional and thoroughly Italian. 

Branding was not the end of our collaboration with Perino. Our portfolio includes their next brand – Amore Pasta – for which the tasks were: brand creation, name creation and packaging designs.
