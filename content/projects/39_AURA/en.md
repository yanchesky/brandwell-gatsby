Is it possible to achieve business success without having a brand? As it turns out – yes, it is! We were invited to bring branding structure to a candle manufacturer. Bispol, as the company is called, was initially imagined as a small business looking to enhance the marketing aspect of its operations.

We attended a briefing and strategic workshops. What we saw was one of several multi-hectare candle factories. The scale of the enterprise was astonishing, especially since neither the name nor its visual identity hinted at such success. For over 20 years, Bispol has dominated the candle market for cemeteries and is well-known within that segment. Other products were branded simply with the Bispol manufacturer’s logo, as if they were private label items.

Of course, the product portfolio wasn’t limited to commemorative candles. It also included a wide range of tealights, scented candles, fragrance diffusers, and candles in every possible color and format. The strategic workshops provided invaluable insights into both the products and the diverse consumer groups. As a result of the strategic work, the products were divided into three categories: Bispol – dedicated to cemetery candles, where brand recognition is already very high. For the mainstream economy segment, a new brand called Aura was created, and for more affluent consumers who value premium quality and minimalist design, the Valpe brand was introduced.

For Aura, we proposed a new visual identity, including a new logo and a fresh graphic design system for the packaging. We had to tackle a vast number of product categories and individual products, each available in a variety of scents that needed to be illustrated. It was a tremendous amount of work that ultimately brought order to Bispol’s product offerings. So, did branding matter this time? Based on the initial feedback from the client, we know that working with a well-defined brand is incomparably easier than without one. The product portfolio has also gained additional image value. These are no longer just scented candles—they are Aura candles!
