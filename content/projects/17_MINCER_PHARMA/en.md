The Mincer Pharma cosmetic brand had been in existence since 1989. Despite professional formulas and technologically advanced cosmetics, it was just one of many brands that went unnoticed. Even its low prices didn't help. From year to year, it was losing market share.

Only aÂ new identity and the professional, pharmaceutical look of its packaging changed that downward trend. Mincer Pharma got new wind in its sails. The simple and very expressive new packaging system was appreciated by consumers, and sales recorded four-digit increases.
