For true lovers of roasted meats, it’s not easy to part with meat. But actually, it’s incredibly easy. Buy any dish from the Plantway brand, prepare it according to the recipe, and serve it without saying what it is. Most likely, everyone will say – "This is chicken, right?"

At Brandwell, we’re already half-vegetarians. We created the Plantway logo and packaging system for these fantastic, perfect, amazing, mouthwatering, divine, vegetarian dishes made from peas. Just plants, pure health, pure pleasure. Plantway is a great way to change your diet. Have a look on: https:\/\/www.plantway.pl
