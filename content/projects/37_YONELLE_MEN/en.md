After less than 10 years of building Yonelle – a brand of success in the segment of luxury skincare cosmetics for women – men have also got their version. At Brandwell, we had the pleasure of designing the Yonelle brand and its packaging. Now we were asked to create Yonelle Men.

Instead of the typical rectangular cartons for the category, we created elegant tubes, referring in their image to the refined spirits from the Scottish highlands. The tube was produced for all product variants and is devoid of any branding, except for the Y embossing on the lid and the pattern on the wall. After removing the label, an elegant tube remains without intrusive branding.

Labels identifying individual product variants are stuck on the tube. The colour range is very subdued and definitely different in the first two products. The next ones will be built in the same graphic system and similar tone. A striking accent is the copper hot stamp with the brand's slogan.

We created Yonelle Men for mature and conscious men. We took care of every detail of this project. From the form, through patterns, typography, to decorations. All to emphasize the unique qualities of these luxurious skincare products for men.
