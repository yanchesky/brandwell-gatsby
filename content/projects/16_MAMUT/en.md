Mamut is one of the largest bakeries in Lower Silesia. It supplies Wrocław and its environs with fresh bread, and their packaged products can be found in stores all over the country. We proposed and implemented a change of identity and new packaging based on a consistent system. New packaging was created for the brand's flagship products – rusks, biscuits and toasts. Then another packaging design for sponge cakes, crispies and meringues. The brand now has its own style, has a clear expression and is truly appetizing.
