After years on the market without any major changes, Luksja has finally undergone a thorough rebranding. Starting from the logo, ending with the entire portfolio packaging redesign.

Luksja is a personal care brand from the economy segment with a very wide market penetration. Affordable products were appreciated and recognizable in the mass market. Although individual products were leaders in their categories, the brand was losing its vitality and freshness. Sarantis, the owner of the brand, has decided to rebrand. He organized a tender from which Brandwell emerged victorious. The changes were very clear and wide-ranging. The logo received a new, contemporary typographic form, which made the brand modern and aspiring, while not distancing itself from regular consumers.

The brand architecture has also been tidied up. The modern and simple form of the Luksja logo facilitated the creation of sub-brands. In addition to these obvious divisions, i.e. Kids, Men, product lines were also created to diversify the category. Silk Care, Creamy & Soft and Aroma Senses created distinct, yet coherent product lines.

Rebranding on a grand scale.

Over 70 products, 5 product lines, a complete change of the brand portfolio in over half a year. Huge challenge completed.

Silk Care promises the exceptional quality of its products. These are the brand's best and selected products. The name of the line, the higher quality of the ingredients and the clearly emphasized creaminess and appetizing flavor demos moved Luksja towards high-quality brands - modern and global.

Aroma Senses is a line where a captivating fragrance is the driving force behind the purchase. Fresh and intense. The design of the packaging emphasized this feature of the products. This line is a bit younger and less conservative. 

There were also two lines targeted at two very specific target groups - children and men. All children's products are available in one fragrance variant - pineapple, hence the hero of the illustration is Mr. Pineapple. When new fragrances appear, new characters will appear.

Luksja Men – masculine and communicating rational benefits. Three in one. Favorite fragrances. The designs are strong, simple and concrete, but at the same time, thanks to modern typography and the lack of unnecessary illustrations, they have significantly gained in aspirations.
