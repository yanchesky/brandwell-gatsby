Perino, a producer of handmade pastas and other flour-based specialties of Italian cuisine, developed its business operating on the HoReCa (Hotel/Restaurant/Catering) market. When the company decided to enter the B2C (business-to-consumer) market, they asked us to create a consumer brand for them.

1. We adopted several important goals for this particular brand design process: 
2. 1.Naming. The creation of a name that would be clearly associated with Italy, but also one simple enough that understanding it wouldn’t require a knowledge of Italian. 
3. 2.Emotions. The use of graphics for the packaging that would not only illustrate the product, but above all evoke emotions, associations and a positive vibe. 
4. 3.A graphics system. One that could be easily modified, work equally well with any type of packaging and prove inexpensive to produce.

Want to serve up a restaurant-quality meal but haven’t either the time, skill or any idea? Here's the easiest way. Add Amore Pasta ravioli to salted boiling water and cook for three minutes. Melt two tablespoons of butter in a frying pan and then take it off the hob. Using a straining ladle, transfer the ravioli to the frying pan and gently mix with the butter. Serve the dish on plates and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Ready to go. So simple and so delicious.

If you see Amore Pasta in the icebox of any Carrefour supermarket – add it to your cart. They are absolutely marvellous handmade Italian deliziosi.
