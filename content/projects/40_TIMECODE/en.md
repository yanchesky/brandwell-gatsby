Celebrating a 20th anniversary is the perfect moment to refresh a brand’s image, especially if the last branding efforts took place a decade ago. Even if a brand already has a well-designed identity, a facelift can help emphasize its vitality, says Pablo Biardzki from Brandwell, the agency responsible for refreshing Timecode’s identity.

Initially, the client requested a subtle identity update and the design of a graphic element highlighting the company’s 20th anniversary. Additionally, the brief called for energizing the brand’s image—with more color and more vibrancy.

The logo underwent a gentle facelift, while the brand’s emblem was created from scratch. Three simple geometric shapes form the symbol of a camera—a device inherently associated with the world of an agency that produces advertising communication. Timecode also gained a new, vibrant color palette. The entire identity reflects the spirit of being forever young at twenty.
