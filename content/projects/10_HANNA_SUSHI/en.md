For the Japanese, sushi is not only food; it’s a lifestyle, a philosophy of healthy eating. In Japan, unlike most Asian countries, spices are used sparingly, striving rather to achieve harmony, delicacy and a fine balance of flavours and aromas. Aesthetics are equally important – colours and composition. Because food is important. It’s a celebration. It should delight.

Hana Sushi is one of the largest sushi restaurant chains in Poland. At Brandwell, we designed its logo, promotional materials and the Sushi Point sub-brand. In the case of each task the guiding idea was to convey the essence of Japanese characteristics – skilful composition and modesty, which ideally express all that is Japanese.
