Purles is a brand in the specialist cosmetics segment – distributed to and through Spa salons. The numbering and clear information architecture helps beauticians quickly define the product while conducting treatments. Cosmetic procedures can be written out in a simple numerical way.

This consumer line required a softening of the asceticism that reigns in the professional section of the market – it was given colours and patterns. Despite that, it hasn’t lost being identified with the professional line and hasn’t created a separate entity. It is only sold in smaller formats and exudes a warmer image.
