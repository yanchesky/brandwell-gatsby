At Brandwell, we designed Evrēe in its entirety, creating its communication positioning, logo, visual identification system, dozens of packaging designs, and advertising.

In just three years, the brand has become an important and recognizable player on the cosmetics market. The client soon spotted copies of their products being introduced by other companies, while we saw how other brands implement the graphic solutions that we applied in "our" Evrēe. When you’re being copied, you know you’re doing something right.

The brand's history is bittersweet. It was incredibly successful, was very much appreciated by consumers, and yet it no longer exists today. Sharp business practices, a hostile takeover, and stories reminiscent of crime fiction, while in the background a great scandal splashed over the front pages of newspapers, until finally the brand became defunct. It's a real pity, because working hard with the company's founders to achieve its success, we were forced to also witness its decline. We are consoled by the fact that our efforts contributed to its truly impressive growth, while "white collar" banksters proved to be responsible for its downfall.
