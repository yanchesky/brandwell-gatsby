Maga – a Polish producer of coleslaws and salads – joined the European foods concern Signature Foods in 2018. The new owner decided to revitalize the brand – to introduce new products, packaging and communication. Brandwell was entrusted with the branding and packaging design tasks.

The first stage of the job was to rejuvenate the brand's logo. It retained the basic features of its prototype, but was made more "civilized" – the font being no longer artificially deformed, and the shield behind the name gained a new character thanks to its more expressive form. The whole package gained an appetizing look, harmony and a professional food image.

Will there be traditional family salads and dishes for the hipster under the banner of this one brand? Will the brand’s umbrella accommodate both of these groups?

Over the years Maga has earned a reputation as a producer of good, traditional coleslaws and salads. The ambition of the new owners was to expand the range offered to include products sought by new generations of customers – those for whom health, the search for new flavours, diet and new nutritional trends are important. The strategic workshops we conducted with the client resulted in establishing the brand’s architecture, in which Maga became the endorser of new, purposeful and precise sub-brands. That’s how Maga’s product Mam Rację (I’m Right) / I have a portion) came about. Maga expanded its range and thus came under the convenience food category.
