Sometimes a product fails to inspire confidence despite being of excellent quality. That was the case with Arkana – good products, but poor branding. The brand’s owner became aware of something missing in the branding. The packaging was modest, transparent, and the lettering was fine, but ... it was completely devoid of expression. It communicated nothing more than the product name and the manufacturer's logo. The way the brand presented itself was a barrier to development rather than any support.

We conducted workshops and strategic analysis. We discovered in which areas of communication the brand failed. We established communication positioning and carried out comprehensive rebranding. The result was a spin change – from a beauty brand to a knowledge brand. Today, Arkana doesn’t have to claim that it offers professional products, because the brand speaks for itself. It exudes professionalism at first glance.
