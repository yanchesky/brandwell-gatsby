Good branding is not the only recipe for success. Companies with poor branding can also achieve much. There comes a time, however, when weak branding forms a barrier to further development. 

A manufacturer of dietary supplements, Vet Expert is respected by veterinarians and breeders alike. It has a great name, an excellent brand slogan and highly valued products. All this, however, did not create a brand. The logo was amateurish and the packaging system lacklustre and inconsistent. A two-year process of change has moved Vet Expert to a position it has long deserved – where it competes with the global giants of the industry in terms of image. The following changes have been made: the graphic system of the packaging, the information architecture, the logo, the language of communication and the style of all communication materials. Today, there is no need to convince anyone that Vet Expert products are of high quality, because the brand exudes professionalism in every aspect.
