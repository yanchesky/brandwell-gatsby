After creating Soraya and Dermika, the author of their success decided to launch an exclusive cosmetic brand. We were involved in the process of its creation. As usual, we conducted brand positioning workshops. Naming was one aspect – creative work aimed at coming up with an appropriate name. This is how Yonelle was born. After the workshops, we created a logo design and a visual identification system. Then came Yonelle Infusion – the first line of face care cosmetics. An attractive, dependable graphic design emphasizing exclusivity and excellent quality cosmetics very soon won the hearts of consumers. Yonelle is the only Polish brand of this class in Douglas drugstores.
