We like company, we like games and we also like to have a conversation. Nothing could have happened to us better than the graphic redesign of a fun social game. What kind? Nice of you to ask. (That’s actually the name of this game)

Sava Gin is a local Warsaw brand, whose name refers to the legend of Wars and Sawa, and the illustration emphasizes the image of a mermaid. Look for its distinctive taste in Warsaw bars. See what happens when you release the gin from the bottle.

In the initial version, the brief assumed only a facelift of an existing game. But we, because we like to play with the design and its colour versions, created a wider range of this game.

During the presentation, the idea of expanding the game to other target groups arose. Ultimately, in addition to the first one, 3 more games were created. Intimate version, for teenagers and for girls.

Are you interested in this unconventional conversation game in one of its versions? Check out the website www.emocjolandia.pl. And, by the way, we also made a new identification for them. Have fun.
