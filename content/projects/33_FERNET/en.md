Fernet is one of the iconic liqueurs in the Stock portfolio from the Croatian market. The task set us was to freshen up the label while keeping the shape of the bottle the same. The challenge in this case was to meet the expectations of conservative, regular customers and at the same time bring the brand up to date, so as to expand its group of consumers. It’s nice to be able to sip a traditional herbal liqueur in a new guise. The design was created in cooperation with Studio Spiritus Movens.
