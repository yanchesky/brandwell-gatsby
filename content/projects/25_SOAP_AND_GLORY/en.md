It happens that a brand’s portfolio is full of products that look as if they have little in common with the brand. Some operate within a certain graphic system, and some elude it. A mish-mash is created, the only common denominator being the logo. In such situations, we usually give the brand’s look some consistency. But what if the approach is different?

Soap and Glory is a cosmetics brand where the packaging for each of its products is different from the rest. Each is individually designed. Even the logo has no permanent location. And yet they are bound together. A 1960s style, the consistent use of a specific palette of colours and fonts, and the characteristic pinup style of the photos create a coherent system. Each package is different, but one can still see that they form a family.

The brand’s owner clearly defined what she meant in the original idea for the brand – "packaging doesn’t have to merely inform. It can be fun, be a playground”. Who else could afford to call their product "The Glow Job". Who would dare to call another product "Sexy Mother Pucker"? Perhaps only the British can get away with such humour.

Soap & Glory is an example of the fact that boldness in business pays off. S&G products continually make the top 10 selling products at Boot's drugstores. The American market also gave the brand an enthusiastic reception, although over there... The Glow Job had to change its name to The Glow Getter.
