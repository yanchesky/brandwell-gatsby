A food company got in touch with Brandwell. Simply speaking, an apple wholesaler. Sounds banal? Not in the least! The company operates on a large scale. It has ambitions and achieves them. It’s not prepared to just look at brands such as Dole or Chiquita, it aims to become such a brand. We were asked to create a brand name and design a logo.

We decided that the name could sound rather abstract, but what was important was that it could be read regardless of the country being supplied and the prevailing language there, that it should sound right and have rhythm. We didn't invent it – we found it, noticed it. The company is based in Bardo Śląski. We liked the sound of that very much. The name meets all the criteria and at the same time provides something else – it equates the brand with the town, and the town with the brand.
