When creating packaging, we always look for a brand’s uniqueness, characteristics, expressiveness and essence. In the case of Expression – a producer of printer toners – the starting points for the creation of a packaging system were expression and halftone raster point. The expression was obvious – this was after all what the brand was called, while the raster is an inherent feature of printing. These two elements resulted in packaging unlike any other in the category. What particularly distinguishes them is the fact that the drawings of characters become all the more legible the greater the distance from which they are viewed.

For the Expression brand, we also created brand architecture, dividing its portfolio into premium and economy products. For the latter we also designed a packaging system. A different one, so as not to raise any doubts that we are dealing with a cheaper, but equally attractive product.
