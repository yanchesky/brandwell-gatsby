Our collaboration with Vet Expert began with a request for a "light tuning of its already designed packaging" and ended with something much bigger. Vet Expert has undergone a deep rebranding, all the brand’s products have received a new graphic system, and that "ready" packaging design was given the heave-ho.

Designing packaging is not only about graphic efficiency and a sense of aesthetics. The meaning and purpose are all important here, and these are preceded by analysis of the brand’s architecture, brand positioning and the establishment of coherent information architecture. Only then can the graphics be approached. We proposed such a path and thanks to that, a spectacular effect was achieved. Strategic choices found expression in the designs. This packaging combines professionalism, a high degree of competence and credibility. The brand not only positioned itself on the market, but even shook it up.
