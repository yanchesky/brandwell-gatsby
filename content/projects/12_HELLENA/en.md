Hellena is one of the most important brands of the Collian foods concern. It’s one with some important and valuable qualities – ease of recognition and credibility. The problem, however, was a not particularly aspiring image and their packaging made them look like cheap discount products. 

The owners of the brand decided to make some changes. Changing the packaging designs was an opportunity to carry out a gentle facelift for the brand. One that would upgrade and civilize the brand without causing it to be misunderstood by faithful consumers.

The case of Hellena is a story of responsibility in design, because in branding, as in medicine, the all important principle is "primum non nocere" – above all, do no harm. Any possible downward fluctuation in sales, even by a few percentage points, translates into multi-million losses on this scale of business. It’s necessary therefore to treat the brand with some caution.

In the mass product category, certain conventions are insurmountable. One must for example show a "demo" – juicy fruit. Despite the conventions and limitations, we managed to find uniqueness and introduce our own style. Hellena beverages no longer look like the cheap fakes of a market leader. They say their own thing. Now the taste of Hellena tempts not only existing, but also new consumers.
