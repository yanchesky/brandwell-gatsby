Lovi belongs to the leader of the Polish parenting market – Canpol Babies. Basically one product contributed to the creation of the brand – the dynamic nipple. A nipple that forces the baby to "work", i.e. actively suckle. This was so innovative, qualitative and costly in terms of production that it initiated the creation of a premium brand, as Canpol previously operated in the economy segment.

This category is saturated with teddy bears, balloons and baby elephants. The end design challenged this convention. We assumed that a mother, while caring for her baby, is above all ... tired. What she really needs is help. We focused on clear and helpful information architecture. Thanks to this, a mother can quickly and confidently select the right product. The category also required the use of a "window" in the packaging to make the product visible. Instead, we suggested that the entire package should be one big window. The product is visible in all its glory and there’s no longer any need to open the packaging to see what the product looks like.

We proposed a modern logo, just like the brand, and at the same time with heart, because after all, tenderness and love pervade this whole category.
