The rebranding of the Permen brand – a leader among dietary supplements in the sexual health category – was part of a broad strategy. Development of the brand’s new architecture, additional names for subsequent products, modern identification, a change of typography and the design of a packaging set. Brandwell was entrusted with the entire scope of the rebranding work. With the help of an advertising campaign, the brand’s new image brought about an over 25% increase in sales, something most unexpected in a non-growth category. In 2016, the Permen brand was awarded the prestigious Effie award.
