Empire is a brand of products for the care of ... footwear, namely technologically advanced preparations for removing dirt from one’s favourite sneakers or eliminating unwanted odours. The German manufacturer Empire decided on rebranding in order for a great product to win new markets. In its previous form, this wouldn’t have been possible.

The brand’s logo and packaging design have undergone change. The brand was given a consistent and expressive new colour. An intense orange has proved a more appropriate colour for younger consumers. It also turned out to be sportier, corresponding with the modern design of sports footwear. The rebranding also included a Respect Sneaker Set intended for the Canadian market.
