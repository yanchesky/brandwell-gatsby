heading: "Lubelska Wódka Biała or White Lublin Vodka sports a clean label for a pure vodka. Pure pleasure."

Lubelska Biała – vodka from the Stock Polska portfolio has been given a new graphic design. The typography has been refreshed and the label has been simplified. Two flavours were designed: Biała Trzy Zboża (White Three Grains) and Biała Winogronowa (White Grape). Each of these comes in three bottle sizes. The design was created thanks to Brandwell joining forces with Spiritus Movens, a studio specializing in design, also structural design, for brands of alcohol.
