How to create a graphic system that is distinctive, powerful and colourful, while using only two colours? And additionally how to make the cost of the bag along with its printing keep within a few pennies?

The mill’s logo is a bit old-school, even reminiscent of the products of yesteryear. That’s on purpose. We wanted it to be associated with something familiar and understandable. The actual packaging, however, is modern and bold. Paradoxically, they are more colourful than the market standard, although, as planned, they use only two colours.

As always, we paid special attention to the information architecture. This one has its own gradation. What is it? Flour. What kind? Universal. What’s it good for? For dumplings, pasta, noodles, etc. All the flours from Młyn Grodziec are described according to this arrangement. For the more informed consumer, we have clearly marked each flour’s type of milling. By following this principle, we help our clients. Even a fellow sent to the store, armed with a piece of paper with the words "flour for dumplings", will not confuse products described in this way.
