Gaps and deficiencies need to be supplemented. This is the conclusion reached by Trec Nutrition from the Aflofarm group. They needed a new identity and packaging system for the newly created Essensey dietary supplement brand, which is why they contacted Brandwell.

In the brief, every other sentence emphasized the essence of nature. Zero bad chemicals, pure nature in its essential form. The logotype is based on a modern single-element font with tight kerning, so as to squeeze even more essence from the typography. The leaf symbol with a droplet adds a touch of natural authenticity to the identity.

A packaging system was also developed. The no-label look on dark, UV-protective jars looks elegant and builds an aspirational, premium character for the brand. The information architecture makes it easy to decode individual products and their benefits.

If someone has deficiencies, they shouldn't ignore them or put them off for later. Especially when it comes to branding, identity, or packaging designs. The effects of support are quickly visible.
