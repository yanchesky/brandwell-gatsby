Strategy. Positioning. Brand Essence.

True is a brand designed for modern men—conscious, demanding, valuing authenticity and real values. Its foundation was developed through a strategic process, based on in-depth analysis of the target audience and workshops that helped define key insights.

Thanks to collaboration with the client, we built the brand's positioning around values important to its audience: independence, a sense of agency, and the ability to distinguish real needs from marketing noise. A fundamental stance also emerged—care. True men take care of themselves, their surroundings, and the world they co-create.

The brand essence is captured in the declaration “I do care” – simple but powerful, standing in opposition to indifference. It is a manifesto of conscious choice, emphasizing that care is not a sign of vanity, but of responsibility. This idea forms the foundation of the name True—synonymous with authenticity, transparency, and quality. The brand doesn’t promise the impossible, nor does it chase fleeting trends. True provides thoughtful, effective solutions that allow men to take care of themselves on their own terms.

Design

True is a brand that communicates through simplicity and functionality. Minimalist, masculine aesthetics go hand in hand with precise typography—Helvetica, one of the most timeless typefaces, highlights the clarity of the message and the classic nature of the brand.

Communication strategy and building awareness

From the very beginning, True has been a brand that consciously selects touchpoints with the customer. Its communication involves thoughtful actions that reinforce its identity and build authentic engagement with its audience.

Strong, true stories.

True doesn’t speak louder—it speaks clearer. In the campaign "I Protect My Face," created in collaboration with the Warsaw Boxing School, the brand referred to real male experiences. Using the symbolism of protection in sports, it emphasized the importance of conscious skincare as a natural part of a man’s lifestyle.

Presence where conscious men are.

True not only creates products for active men but also actively supports their passions. Its partnership in the prestigious Iron Man triathlon highlighted the brand’s position as a companion in challenges where endurance, determination, and self-care go hand in hand.

Product Range

True started with three products, gradually expanding its portfolio. The brand is dynamically extending its range, introducing more innovative solutions in the categories of face care, face wash, and body care. The latest introduction is the True™ Sun Care line.

True is available at Douglas, Aelia stores at airports, and online at Notino and the official website https:\/\/truemenskincare.com.

True is a brand that matures alongside its customers. Every new product, every new campaign, and every strategic move is thoughtfully planned to build not just reach but, above all, long-term value.
