True is another example of how we work on brand building. We defined its consumers – mature and modern men with professional achievements. We looked into their needs, values and attitude to the category.

Thanks to strategic workshops, we created the brand’s positioning, where the consumers’ convictions about their own worth, self-sufficiency and self-determination stand out. What also emerged was the ability to differentiate between bullshit and real values, and the fact that they care ... They care about their work, family, and the world they together are creating.

The laconic essence of the "I do care" brand promises real action. It is also in opposition to the indifference of "I don't care". Based on the developed positioning and the ensuing essence, we created the name True. It expresses the sense of a brand that doesn’t aim to change, beautify or seduce anyone with promises of rejuvenation. It simply wants to help us take care of ourselves. The packaging design – modern, masculine, clear and classy – avoids exaggeration while emanating strength. Helvetica – one of the best fonts in the history of typography helps in achieving these goals.
